# Expense Analysis: Spot Spending Patterns Before They Become Problems

> **Purpose**: Understand where money goes, compare year-over-year trends, and identify optimization opportunities.

## Why Track Expenses?

**The painful truth**: Most people know roughly how much they earn, but have no idea where it all goes.

**The result**:
- Money disappears mysteriously
- Surprised by low account balance
- Can't explain why saving is hard
- Feeling out of control financially

**With expense tracking**:
- See exactly where money flows
- Spot patterns and trends
- Make informed decisions ("Cut this, keep that")
- Feel in control and intentional

## The Expenses Page

From your dashboard navigation, access the **Expenses** page to see 3 key visualizations + full transaction history.

### Chart 1: Year-over-Year Comparison

**What It Shows**: This year's spending vs last year's spending, month-by-month cumulative, with forecast.

**Why It Matters**:
- See if you're spending more or less than last year
- Forecast helps plan: "At this rate, I'll spend €X by year-end"
- Identify spending inflation before it becomes a problem

**How to Read It**:
```
Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec
[Current Year - solid line, growing]
[Last Year - dotted line, for comparison]
[Forecast - projected to Dec]
```

**Real Examples**:

**Scenario 1: Under Control**
```
2024 line: Below 2023 line all year
Result: You're spending less than last year. Great job!
```

**Scenario 2: Lifestyle Inflation**
```
2024 line: 15% above 2023 line
Question: Did income also increase 15%? If not, lifestyle inflation is eating savings.
```

### Chart 2: Expenses by Merchant

**What It Shows**: Top merchants that take most of your money (last 12 months), displayed as donut chart.

**Why It Matters**: Reveal spending concentration. Often, 3-5 merchants account for 50%+ of expenses.

**How to Read It**:

Shows **top merchants** until they represent **80% of total spending**, then groups rest as "Other".

**Key Insights**:

**Concentration Analysis**:
- **High concentration** (top 3 = 60%): Easy to optimize. Focus on those 3.
- **Low concentration** (top 10 = 50%): Diffuse spending. Harder to pinpoint savings.

**Surprise Factor**:
- Often merchants you forgot about: "I didn't realize I spend that much there"
- Subscriptions add up: "€20/month × 12 = €240/year for a service I barely use"

**Quick Win**: Export merchants list. Check if you can:
- Switch to cheaper alternative (different grocery store?)
- Cancel recurring charge (subscription not used?)
- Negotiate better rate (phone bill, insurance?)

---

### Chart 3: Expenses by Type

**What It Shows**: Spending split by transaction type (e.g., recurring vs one-time, essential vs discretionary).

**Why It Matters**: Understand spending flexibility. Recurring expenses are hard to cut. One-time expenses are optional.

**Example Categories**:
```
Recurring: 45% (monthly subscriptions, insurance, rent)
Essential: 30% (groceries, utilities, gas)
Discretionary: 20% (dining out, entertainment, shopping)
One-Time: 5% (car repair, appliance replacement)
```

**Key Insights**:

**High Recurring %** (>50%):
- Less flexibility month-to-month
- Focus on reducing recurring costs (cancel subscriptions, negotiate rates)
- Any cut here = permanent savings

**High Discretionary %** (>30%):
- More room to optimize
- Easy to cut temporarily if needed (savings push, emergency)
- Lifestyle creep risk: discretionary becomes "necessary"

## Common Spending Patterns

### Pattern 1: Creeping Subscriptions

**What It Looks Like**: Merchant chart shows many small recurring vendors (~€10-30 each).

**Why It Happens**: Subscribe and forget. Services add up over months.

**Fix**:
- Export merchant list
- Cancel 3 lowest-value subscriptions
- Save €30-60/month = €360-720/year

---

### Pattern 2: Impulse Splurges

**What It Looks Like**: Type chart shows high discretionary %, transaction table shows frequent small purchases.

**Why It Happens**: "Treat yourself" mentality, lack of friction (one-click shopping).

**Fix**:
- Implement 48-hour rule (wait 2 days before non-essential purchase)
- Unlink credit cards from shopping apps
- Reduce discretionary by 20% → Save €200+/month

---

### Pattern 3: Lifestyle Inflation

**What It Looks Like**: YoY chart shows spending growing 10-20% despite same lifestyle.

**Why It Happens**: Income increases, spending increases proportionally (or more).

**Fix**:
- Freeze lifestyle at current level
- Save 100% of next raise
- Keep expenses flat while income grows

---

### Pattern 4: Seasonal Spikes

**What It Looks Like**: YoY chart shows December/holiday season spikes every year.

**Why It Happens**: Gifts, travel, celebrations.

**Fix**:
- Not necessarily bad (planned annual spending)
- Budget for it: Save €X per month all year for December
- Avoid surprise debt: Pre-save instead of credit card binge

## How to Optimize Expenses

### Step 1: Identify Top 3 Merchants (80/20 Rule)

3 merchants likely account for 40-60% of spending. Focus there for maximum impact.

**Example**:
- Grocery Store: €400/month → Switch to Aldi, save €80/month
- Dining Out: €300/month → Cook more, save €100/month
- Gas Station: €200/month → Carpool 2 days/week, save €40/month

**Total: €220/month = €2,640/year from 3 changes.**

---

### Step 2: Cut Low-Value Subscriptions

**Exercise**: List all recurring charges. Ask per subscription:
- Do I use this weekly? (If no → candidate for cut)
- Does this improve my life materially? (If no → cut)
- Would I re-subscribe if canceled? (If no → cut)

**Typical savings**: €50-150/month

---

### Step 3: Implement Spending Rules

**Rule 1: 48-Hour Wait (Discretionary >€50)**
- Prevents impulse purchases
- Forces intentionality
- Reduces buyer's remorse

**Rule 2: One-In-One-Out (Possessions)**
- Buy new shirt → Donate old shirt
- Reduces accumulation and spending

**Rule 3: Cash Envelope (Problem Categories)**
- Withdraw €X cash for dining out
- When envelope empty, no more dining out that month
- Forces awareness and limits

---

### Step 4: Negotiate Recurring Costs

**Candidates**:
- Insurance (home, auto, health)
- Phone/internet plans
- Gym membership
- Subscriptions (Spotify, Netflix, etc.)

**Script**: "I've been a loyal customer for [X years]. What discounts or promotions can you offer to reduce my bill?"

**Expected success rate**: 30-50% will offer discount. Saves €20-100/month.

---

## Tracking Best Practices

### Update Frequency

**Option 1: Weekly Micro-Updates** (5 min/week)
- Log transactions as they happen
- Less end-of-month data entry
- Better awareness of daily spending

**Option 2: Monthly Batch** (20 min/month)
- Export bank/credit card CSV
- Paste into Google Sheets all at once
- Faster but less real-time awareness

**Recommended**: Start with monthly batch. If you struggle with control, switch to weekly.

---

### Categorization Tips

**Keep it simple**:
- 5-10 categories max (groceries, dining, transport, utilities, shopping, entertainment, etc.)
- Too many categories = analysis paralysis
- Goal is trends, not forensic accounting

**Be consistent**:
- "Restaurant" vs "Dining Out" vs "Food" → Pick one, stick with it
- Consistency enables year-over-year comparison

---

### When to Review

**Monthly** (5 minutes):
- Check YoY chart: "Spending up or down vs last year?"
- Review merchant chart: "Any surprises?"
- Scan transaction table: "Any unexpected charges?"

**Quarterly** (15 minutes):
- Deep dive: "Which category to optimize this quarter?"
- Implement 1-2 changes (cancel subscription, switch provider)
- Measure impact next month

**Annually** (30 minutes):
- Year-end review: "Did I meet spending goals?"
- Set next year target: "Reduce total expenses 10%?"
- Celebrate wins: "Saved €3k vs last year!"

---

## Common Questions

### "My expenses are higher than last year. Is that bad?"

**Depends**:
- **Income also increased?** Lifestyle inflation is fine if affordable.
- **Planned large purchase?** (Car, home repair, vacation) → Expected, not concerning.
- **Unplanned creep?** (No reason, just spending more) → Time to investigate and adjust.

**Check**: Compare to income. If expenses grew faster than income, unsustainable.

---

### "I can't identify optimization opportunities. Everything feels necessary."

**Try this**:
1. **Highlight test**: Print merchant list. Highlight vendors you'd keep if income dropped 20%. Everything unhighlighted = cuttable.
2. **Lifestyle rewind**: What did you spend 3 years ago? Probably 20-30% less. You survived. What changed?

**Hard truth**: If you can't find 10% to cut, lifestyle inflation is controlling you. Challenge every "necessity".

---

### "Should I track every €2 coffee?"

**Two schools of thought**:

**Team Detailed Tracking**:
- "€2 × 5 days × 52 weeks = €520/year. Track it!"
- Awareness changes behavior

**Team Sanity Preserved**:
- "Life is short. Don't obsess over coffee."
- Focus on big wins (subscriptions, insurance, rent)
- Track only >€20 transactions

**Recommended**: Start detailed for 3 months to build awareness. Then switch to €20+ threshold to maintain sanity.
