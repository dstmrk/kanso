# Net Worth Tracking: See Where Your Wealth is Growing

> **Purpose**: Understand wealth composition and evolution. Track asset growth and liability payoff over time.

## What Is Net Worth (And Why It Matters)

**Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities**

It's the single number that represents your financial position. Not your salary, not your savings account balance—your **total wealth**.

### Why Track Net Worth?

**Income is vanity. Net worth is sanity.**

- You can earn €100k/year and have €0 net worth (if you spend it all)
- You can earn €40k/year and have €200k net worth (if you save consistently)

**Net worth tells you**:
- Are you building wealth or treading water?
- Are assets growing faster than liabilities?
- Are you making financial progress year-over-year?

## The Net Worth Evolution Chart

From your dashboard, click the **Net Worth card** to access the detailed Net Worth page.

### What You See

A **stacked bar chart** showing your financial position over time:

- **Green sections** (top half): Your assets, broken down by type
- **Red sections** (bottom half): Your liabilities, broken down by type
- **Net position**: The difference between green and red

### How to Read It

**Example Chart**:
```
Month:  Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr
       [███]   [███]   [███]   [███]  ← Investments
       [███]   [███]   [███]   [███]  ← Cash
       [███]   [███]   [███]   [███]  ← Property
       ─────   ─────   ─────   ─────  ← Zero line
       [███]   [███]   [███]   [███]  ← Mortgage
       [███]   [█]     [█]     [█]    ← Credit Card (shrinking!)
```

**What to Look For**:

1. **Growing green sections**: Assets accumulating (good!)
2. **Shrinking red sections**: Liabilities being paid off (great!)
3. **Net distance from zero**: Getting further from zero line = wealth growing
4. **Composition changes**: Which asset classes are growing? Which liabilities declining?

### Real-World Insights

**Example 1: The Investor**
```
Assets:
- Cash: Stable €5k (emergency fund)
- Investments: Growing from €20k → €35k (over 12 months)

Liabilities:
- None

Result: Net worth +€15k. Investments doing the heavy lifting.
```

**Example 2: The Homeowner**
```
Assets:
- Property: Stable €250k (home value)
- Cash: €10k

Liabilities:
- Mortgage: Shrinking from €200k → €195k (monthly payments)

Result: Net worth +€5k. Mortgage payoff creating slow, steady wealth.
```

**Example 3: The Debt Payoff Journey**
```
Assets:
- Cash: Stable €3k

Liabilities:
- Student Loan: €30k → €25k (aggressive payoff)
- Credit Card: €5k → €0 (paid off!)

Result: Net worth +€10k. Liabilities down = wealth up, even without adding assets.
```

## Asset Types (Green Sections)

### What to Track

**Liquid Assets** (easy to access):
- Cash (checking, savings accounts)
- Investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs)
- Cryptocurrency

**Illiquid Assets** (harder to convert to cash):
- Property (home, investment real estate)
- Vehicles
- Business equity
- Precious metals

**What NOT to Track**:
- Household items (furniture, clothes)
- Personal collectibles (unless significant value)
- Anything you wouldn't sell in a financial emergency

### How to Value Assets

- **Cash**: Exact balance
- **Investments**: Current market value (check brokerage account)
- **Property**: Conservative estimate (Zillow, recent comparable sales)
- **Vehicles**: Kelly Blue Book or similar
- **Crypto**: Current exchange rate

**Important**: Be consistent. Use same valuation method each month for accurate trends.

---

## Liability Types (Red Sections)

### What to Track

**Secured Debt** (backed by asset):
- Mortgage
- Auto loan
- Home equity line of credit (HELOC)

**Unsecured Debt** (no collateral):
- Credit cards
- Student loans
- Personal loans
- Medical debt

**What NOT to Track**:
- Upcoming bills (utilities, insurance) - these are expenses, not debt
- Money owed to friends/family (unless formal loan)

### How to Value Liabilities

- **Current outstanding balance**, not original loan amount
- Include principal only (not future interest)
- Update monthly after payments

**Example**: €200k mortgage at start of year, €195k after 12 months of payments.

## Common Patterns and What They Mean

### Pattern 1: Steady Climb

**What It Looks Like**: Green sections growing, red sections shrinking or stable, net worth increasing consistently.

**What It Means**: You're doing great. Saving regularly, managing debt well.

**Action**: Keep going! Consider increasing savings rate if possible.

---

### Pattern 2: Volatile But Upward

**What It Looks Like**: Month-to-month fluctuations, but year-over-year trend is positive.

**What It Means**: Investment-heavy portfolio or irregular income. Short-term noise, long-term progress.

**Action**: Focus on annual trend, ignore monthly swings.

---

### Pattern 3: Flat Line

**What It Looks Like**: Assets and liabilities both stable. Net worth not growing.

**What It Means**: Income = expenses. You're maintaining but not building wealth.

**Action**: Increase income or decrease expenses to start growth.

---

### Pattern 4: Red Expanding

**What It Looks Like**: Liabilities growing (credit cards, loans piling up).

**What It Means**: Spending more than earning. Unsustainable trajectory.

**Action**: Emergency. Stop adding debt, create payoff plan, increase income or cut expenses.

## How to Grow Net Worth

Three levers. Pull all of them.

### Lever 1: Increase Assets

**Strategies**:
- Save consistently (pay yourself first)
- Invest for growth (stocks, index funds)
- Increase income (raise, side hustle, career advancement)
- Let compound interest work (time in market)

**Quick Win**: Automate savings. Transfer €X to investments every payday before you can spend it.

---

### Lever 2: Decrease Liabilities

**Strategies**:
- Pay off high-interest debt first (credit cards, personal loans)
- Refinance if rates dropped (mortgage, student loans)
- Avoid new debt (lifestyle inflation control)
- Make extra principal payments when possible

**Quick Win**: Snowball method. Pay off smallest debt first for psychological momentum.

---

### Lever 3: Optimize Both

**Advanced Strategies**:
- Leverage low-interest debt for high-return investments (mortgage at 3% while earning 8% on stocks)
- Balance debt payoff vs investment contributions (pay off >7% interest debt, invest if <4%)
- Rebalance portfolio regularly (sell winners, buy losers)

**Warning**: Don't optimize too early. If you have credit card debt, pay it off before worrying about investment allocation.

---

## Tracking Best Practices

### Update Frequency

**Monthly is ideal**:
- First of month: Update all balances in Google Sheets
- 5 minutes total
- Consistent tracking reveals trends

**Don't obsess daily**: Net worth is a long-term metric. Daily checks add stress without value.

---

### Data Entry Tips

**For Assets**:
- Log into each account once per month
- Record exact balances (don't estimate)
- Property: Update every 6-12 months (values don't change daily)

**For Liabilities**:
- Check loan statements after payment
- Record remaining principal (not original amount)
- Credit cards: Record after statement closes (not mid-cycle)

---

### Goal Setting

**Use Net Worth for Goals**:
- "Reach €100k net worth by age 30"
- "Increase net worth 15% this year"
- "Get to debt-free (€0 liabilities) by 2026"

**Better than income goals**:
- "Earn €80k" doesn't guarantee wealth if you spend €80k
- "Increase net worth €20k" forces saving behavior

## Common Questions

### "I have negative net worth. Am I doing something wrong?"

**Not necessarily**:
- Common for students (loans), young professionals (mortgage > equity), small business owners (startup debt)
- What matters: Is the trend improving? Are you paying down debt faster than accumulating new debt?

**Red flag**: Negative net worth **and** getting worse (adding debt without income growth).

---

### "My property value dropped. Should I update it?"

**Yes, but don't panic**:
- Real estate fluctuates. Update to realistic value, but don't obsess.
- Long-term, property appreciates. Short-term dips are normal.

**When to worry**: If neighborhood is declining or major structural issues. Otherwise, ride it out.

---

### "Should I include my car as an asset?"

**Depends**:
- **Yes** if it has resale value (€5k+)
- **No** if it's old and depreciated fully

**Rule of thumb**: Include if you'd sell it to pay off debt in an emergency.

---

### "My investments dropped 20%. Is my net worth ruined?"

**No**:
- Market volatility is normal. Unrealized losses aren't permanent.
- Keep tracking monthly. You'll see recovery over time.
- Don't panic sell. Compounding requires staying invested through dips.
