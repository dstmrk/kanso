# Dashboard: Your Financial Health at a Glance

> **Purpose**: Answer "Am I doing okay?" in 10 seconds. See trends without drowning in data.

## The 4 Key Metrics

Your dashboard shows 4 cards that tell the complete story of your financial health. Each metric answers a specific question.

### 1. Net Worth: "How much am I worth?"

**What It Shows**: Total assets minus total liabilities. The single number that represents your entire financial position.

**Why It Matters**: This is your financial scoreboard. Going up = winning. Going down = time to investigate.

**How to Read It**:
```
Net Worth: €45,230
As of 2024-10
```

- **Positive number**: You own more than you owe (assets > liabilities)
- **Negative number**: You owe more than you own (not uncommon when young with student loans/mortgage)
- **Trend**: More important than absolute number. Growing = good, shrinking = needs attention.

**Real Examples**:

- **€15,000 → €18,000** (3 months): Great! You're building wealth
- **€80,000 → €78,000** (1 month): Check why. Car purchase? Investment loss? Expected or concerning?
- **-€20,000 → -€15,000** (6 months): Paying off debt faster than accumulating new debt. Progress!

**Click Action**: Takes you to Net Worth detail page for full asset/liability breakdown.

### 2. MoM Δ (Month-over-Month Change): "Did I grow this month?"

**What It Shows**: How much your net worth changed compared to last month, both in percentage and absolute amount.

**Why It Matters**: Short-term progress check. Tells you if your recent financial decisions are working.

**How to Read It**:
```
MoM Δ: +3.2%
+€1,450 compared to last month
```

- **Green (positive)**: Net worth increased. You're saving more than spending or investments grew.
- **Red (negative)**: Net worth decreased. Large purchase? Market downturn? Expected or not?

**Typical Patterns**:

- **Consistent +2-5%**: Excellent saving habits, steady income
- **Occasional -10%**: Large purchase (car, vacation). Check if planned.
- **Volatile ±5%**: Investment-heavy portfolio or irregular income

**When to Worry**: Consistent negative months without explanation (uncontrolled spending or income drop).

---

### 3. YoY Δ (Year-over-Year Change): "Am I better off than last year?"

**What It Shows**: Net worth change compared to same month last year. Removes seasonal fluctuations.

**Why It Matters**: Long-term trajectory. Smooths out monthly noise (Christmas spending, vacation months, bonuses).

**How to Read It**:
```
YoY Δ: +12.5%
+€5,120 compared to last year
```

- **+10-20%**: Strong financial progress
- **+5-10%**: Steady improvement
- **0-5%**: Slow growth or break-even
- **Negative**: Serious issue unless explainable (job change, major life event)

**Typical Patterns**:

- **December low, January high**: Bonus month effect
- **Consistent growth**: Disciplined saving and/or investment gains
- **Stagnant**: Income = expenses, no net saving

**Key Insight**: If MoM is volatile but YoY is positive, you're doing fine. Short-term fluctuations average out.

### 4. Avg Saving Ratio: "What % of income am I keeping?"

**What It Shows**: Average percentage of monthly income saved over the last 12 months.

**Why It Matters**: The #1 predictor of long-term wealth. High income doesn't matter if you spend it all.

**How to Read It**:
```
Avg Saving Ratio: 32%
€1,280 saved on average each month
```

**Color Coding**:

- **Green (>40%)**: Excellent saving habits. Building wealth fast.
- **Yellow (20-40%)**: Healthy range. Making progress.
- **Red (<20%)**: Warning zone. Little to no wealth accumulation.

**Benchmarks by Life Stage**:

| Stage | Target | Reality Check |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Young Professional** | 20-30% | Building emergency fund + starting investments |
| **Mid-Career** | 30-50% | Peak earning years, accelerate savings |
| **High Earner** | 40-60% | Lifestyle inflation controlled, wealth compounds |
| **Pre-Retirement** | 50%+ | Final push before income drops |

**Real Examples**:

- **18% → 25%** (6 months): Raised income or cut unnecessary expenses. Great progress!
- **45% → 20%** (1 month): Large purchase pulled savings down. Normal if planned.
- **Stuck at 10%** (12 months): Spending = income. Needs lifestyle adjustment or income boost.

## The 5 Dashboard Charts

Below the 4 KPI cards, you'll see 5 charts that provide deeper context.

### Chart 1: Net Worth (Top Row, Left)

**What It Shows**: Your net worth over time. Simple line chart.

**Use Case**: See the big picture. Is the trend line pointing up? Any concerning dips?

**What to Look For**:
- **Steady upward slope**: You're winning
- **Plateau**: Income = expenses, no net progress
- **Downward slope**: Spending more than earning or major loss

---

### Chart 2: Asset vs Liabilities (Top Row, Right)

**What It Shows**: Two stacked bars - one for assets, one for liabilities. Shows composition.

**Use Case**: Understand where wealth is stored and where debt lives.

**Example Insights**:
- "Most assets in cash? Time to invest."
- "Liabilities growing? Check if intentional (mortgage) or concerning (credit cards)."

---

### Chart 3: Cash Flow (Bottom Row, Left)

**What It Shows**: Income (green) vs Expenses (red) bars over time. The gap = savings.

**Use Case**: Spot income/expense trends. Widening gap = saving more. Narrowing gap = lifestyle inflation.

**Red Flags**:
- Expenses consistently above income (red taller than green)
- Income stable but expenses creeping up (lifestyle inflation)

**Green Flags**:
- Growing gap (income rising faster than expenses)
- Stable expenses despite income growth (controlled lifestyle)

---

### Chart 4: Avg Expenses (Bottom Row, Middle)

**What It Shows**: Average expenses by category (last 12 months).

**Use Case**: See where money goes on average. Identify categories to optimize.

**Common Surprises**:
- "I didn't realize I spend that much on [category]"
- "Subscriptions add up to €200/month?"

---

### Chart 5: Income vs Expenses (Bottom Row, Right)

**What It Shows**: Monthly income and expenses side-by-side.

**Use Case**: Month-by-month comparison. See seasonal patterns.

**Typical Patterns**:
- December spike (holidays)

## Common Questions

### "My net worth dropped 10% this month. Is that bad?"

**Depends**:
- **Planned large purchase** (car, vacation, home down payment)? Normal.
- **Investment market drop**? Temporary, will recover.
- **Unexpected overspending**? Time to investigate expense breakdown.

**Check**: Look at expense charts. Did one category spike?

### "My saving ratio is 5%. How do I improve it?"

Three levers:
1. **Increase income** (raise, side hustle, freelance)
2. **Decrease expenses** (cut discretionary spending, subscriptions, dining out)
3. **Both** (most effective)

**Start here**: Review Avg Expenses chart. Which category could you reduce 20%?

### "I have positive net worth but negative cash flow. How?"

**Explanation**: Assets are growing (investments appreciating, property value up) but monthly expenses exceed income.

**Is it bad?**: Depends. If short-term (between jobs, sabbatical), okay. If long-term, unsustainable.

**Fix**: Either increase income or reduce expenses to turn cash flow positive.

### "Should I focus on MoM or YoY?"

**Both**:
- **MoM**: Short-term feedback loop. Tells you if this month's decisions worked.
- **YoY**: Long-term trajectory. Tells you if you're making annual progress.

**Prioritize YoY** if MoM is volatile due to irregular income/expenses. Annual trend matters more.
